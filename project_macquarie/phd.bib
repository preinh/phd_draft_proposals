The Anthropocene, on current evidence, seems to show global change consistent with the suggestion that an epoch-scale boundary has been crossed within the last two centuries.},

	abstract = {Systems and infrastructures are currently being developed to support Web services. The main idea is to encapsulate an organization's functionality within an appropriate interface and advertise it as Web services. While in some cases Web services may be utilized in an isolated form, it is normal to expect Web services to be integrated as part of workflow processes. The composition of workflow processes that model e-service applications differs from the design of traditional workflows, in terms of the number of tasks (Web services) available to the composition process, in their heterogeneity, and in their autonomy. Therefore, two problems need to be solved: how to efficiently discover Web services—based on functional and operational requirements—and how to facilitate the interoperability of heterogeneous Web services. In this paper, we present a solution within the context of the emerging Semantic Web that includes use of ontologies to overcome some of the problem. We describe a prototype that has been implemented to illustrate how discovery and interoperability functions are achieved more efficiently.},

A key emerging concept is scientific workflows, which provide a declarative representation of complex scientific applications that can be automatically managed and executed in distributed shared resources. In the coming decades, computational experimentation will push the boundaries of current cyberinfrastructure in terms of inter-disciplinary scope and integrative models of scientific phenomena under study. This paper argues that knowledge-rich workflow environments will provide necessary capabilities for that vision by assisting scientists to validate and vet complex analysis processes and by automating important aspects of scientific exploration and discovery.},

Earth Systems Science is the basis for understanding all aspects of anthropogenic global change, such as chemically forced global climate change. The work is aimed at those students interested in the emerging scientific discipline. Earth Systems Science is an integrated discipline that has been rapidly developing over the last two decades. New information is included in this updated edition so that the text remains relevant. This volume contains five new chapters, but of special importance is the inclusion of an expanded set of student exercises. The two senior authors are leading scientists in their fields and have been awarded numerous prizes for their research efforts. * First edition was widely adopted * Authors are highly respected in their field * Global climate change, integral to the book, is now one of the most important issues in atmospheric sciences and oceanography.},

	title = {Specific ion-exchange chromatography and fluorimetric assay for urinary 3-{O}-methyldopamine},
	volume = {116},
	abstract = {A technique for the selective extraction of 3-O-methyldopamine, normetanephrine and metanephrine from a single urine sample has been investigated. After hydrolysis of the conjugates, the diluted mixture is passed through a Dowex 50W-X2 column and the methoxylated amines are eluted by means of concentrated ammonia. The eluate, containing metanephrine, normetanephrine and 3-O-methyldopamine is evaporated, and a solution of the residue in borate buffer is fractionated under strictly controlled conditions on an Amberlite CG-50 column. The three amines so separated are estimated by specific fluorimetric methods. The extraction recovery is 80 +/- 3\% for pure solutions and 78 +/- 4\% for 3-O-methyldopamine added to urine. The fluorimetric procedure, carried out under well-defined conditions, allows the estimation of 10 ng of 3-O-methethyldopamine. The spectral characteristics of the fluorescent derivative are similar to those obtained with dopamine, so that it can be assumed that iodine oxidation of 3-O-methyldopamine demethylates this compound and oxidises the resulting dopamine to the dopamine fluorophore (5,6-dihydroxy-indole). Of the compounds that might interfere in the fluorimetric procedure, dopamine, DOPA and alpha-methyl-DOPA are destroyed by the ammoniacal elution from the Dowex column and 3-O-methyl-DOPA is eliminated in the effluent from the Amberlite column. The elimination of interfering compounds and the improved separation on Amberlite ensure high specificity for this procedure. We have applied the method to normal urine and to pathological urines from patients with adrenergic tumours or untreated and treated parkinsonian subjects; vital information has been obtained on the prognosis of adrenergic tumours. The presence of large amounts of dopamine, normetanephrine and/or metanephrine does not affect the assay for 3-O-methyldopamine. The method is also applicable to rat and dog urine, and can be applied to tissue extracts with little modification.},
